	Short: "Converts CSV/TSV/PSV fiels to SFGA format",
	Long: `Imports data from Comma-Separated Value (CSV), Tab-Separated
Value (TSV), or Pipe-Separated Value (PSV) files and converts it into
the Species File Group Archive (SFGA) format.

This command is designed for transforming tabular data, commonly used in
biological and taxonomic datasets, into a structured SFGA database.

INPUT REQUIREMENTS:

Header Row: The XSV file *must* include a header row as the first line.
  This row defines the column names for the data.

Column Names: Column names should correspond to either Darwin Core or
  CoLDP (Catalogue of Life Data Package) terms. This ensures the data is
  correctly mapped into the SFGA structure.

ScientificName Field: A column named "ScientificName" is *mandatory*.
  This field contains the scientific names of taxa. Other columns, while
  optional, allow for a more comprehensive dataset.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// fromXsvCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	fromXsvCmd.Flags().StringP("delimiter", "d", "",
		`delimiter used in the file:
  auto, csv, tsv, psv are supported
  auto is default.`)
