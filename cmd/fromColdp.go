file and converts it into the Species File Group Archive (SFGA) format.
CoLDP is a standardized format for taxonomic data, and this command
allows you to integrate such data into the SFGA ecosystem.

The command requires the path to the input CoLDP file (which should be a
ZIP archive) and the desired path for the output SFGA file.

Example:

  sf from coldp my_coldp_data.zip /path/to/output-sfga

Input can be either a local file or a URL to a remote CoLDP file.
If an output path is not provided, it will be generated in the current
directory.`,
