	Use:   "from",
	Short: "Converts a variety of formats to SFGA format",
	Long: `Converts a variety of data formats into the Species File
Group Archive (SFGA) format.

This command offers several subcommands to facilitate the conversion from
various sources:

text: Imports a simple text file, where each line contains a scientific name.

xsv: Imports data from Comma-Separated Value (CSV), Tab-Separated
	Value (TSV), or Pipe-Separated Value (PSV) files. These files must contain
	a header row with column names that correspond to Darwin Core or CoLDP terms.
	At a minimum, the "ScientificName" field is required.

coldp: Imports data structured in the Catalogue of Life Data Package
	(CoLDP) format.

dwca: Imports data from Darwin Core Archive (DwCA) files, a common
	format for sharing biodiversity data.

tw: Imports data from a TaxonWorks project.

The resulting SFGA files can be used for further analysis, comparison with
other datasets, or conversion to other formats supported by this program.

    sf from xsv mydata.csv output.sfga

	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
	// 	_ = cmd.Help()
	// },
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(fromCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	fromCmd.PersistentFlags().BoolP("zip-output", "z", false, "compress output with zip")
	fromCmd.PersistentFlags().BoolP("parse-details", "p", false, "use detailed parsing of names")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// fromCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
