# sf
`sf` is a universal converter between biodiversity exchange formats.

The `sf` app converts most popular biodiversity formats to each other and
is able to compare them. It is very useful for maintaining checklists, or
for adjusting a local checklist for a global consumption.

The program uses Species File Group Archive (SFGA) format as an intermediary.
SFGA is based on SQLite database, easily exchangeable (just one file) stable
(SQLite promises backward compatibility until 2050), makes it easy to query and
modify (via SQL language) and even be used as a standard backend for an
ecosystem of applications.
